# Particle Emitter 

This project was an exploration of JavaScript programming while I was still a bit green and needed to fill my time while on contract with a now defunct team at Microsoft. As I was needed to be present and onsite my manager allowed me to spend time exploring and expanding my skills, as long as the assigned work items were complete.

My original code was designed and written using Firefox and I also made sure it would run in the infamous IE6.
